        <h2 id="part1">Abstract</h2>
        <p>Ageing is a major risk factor for many neurological pathologies, but its mechanisms remain unclear. Unlike other tissues, the parenchyma of the central nervous system (CNS) lacks lymphatic vasculature and waste products are removed partly through a paravascular route. (Re)discovery and characterization of meningeal lymphatic vessels has prompted an assessment of their role in waste clearance from the CNS. Here we show that meningeal lymphatic vessels drain macromolecules from the CNS (cerebrospinal and interstitial fluids) into the cervical lymph nodes in mice. Impairment of meningeal lymphatic function slows paravascular influx of macromolecules into the brain and efflux of macromolecules from the interstitial fluid, and induces cognitive impairment in mice. Treatment of aged mice with vascular endothelial growth factor C enhances meningeal lymphatic drainage of macromolecules from the cerebrospinal fluid, improving brain perfusion and learning and memory performance. Disruption of meningeal lymphatic vessels in transgenic mouse models of Alzheimer’s disease promotes amyloid-β deposition in the meninges, which resembles human meningeal pathology, and aggravates parenchymal amyloid-β accumulation. Meningeal lymphatic dysfunction may be an aggravating factor in Alzheimer’s disease pathology and in age-associated cognitive decline. Thus, augmentation of meningeal lymphatic function might be a promising therapeutic target for preventing or delaying age-associated neurological diseases.</p>

One month after injection, the mice were tested in the open field (OF) and in the MWM. <b>b</b>, <b>c</b>, Total distance and percentage of time in the centre of the open field arena was not ameliorated by treatment of J20 mice with mVEGF-C. <b>d-f</b>, No statistically significant differences were observed in the acquisition (<b></b>d), in the probe trial (<b>e</b>) or in the reversal (<b>f</b>) of the MWM test after one month of mVEGF-C treatment. Data in b–f are mean ±  ± s.e.m., <i>n</i> = 11 mice treated with eGFP, <i>n</i> = 12 mice treated with mVEGF-C; two-tailed Mann–Whitney U-test (<b>b, c, e</b>), repeated-measures two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni’s post hoc test (<b>d, f</b>); data were from a single experiment. <b>g</b>, J20 mice were treated with eGFP or mVEGF-C and, one month later, CSF, meninges and brain were collected for analysis. <b>h</b>, Representative images of DAPI (blue) and LYVE-1+ lymphatic vessels (green) in the superior sagittal sinus of mice treated with either eGFP or mVEGF-C. Scale bar, 500 μm. i, AAV1-mediated expression of mVEGF-C did not affect meningeal lymphatic vessel diameter. <b>j</b>, Levels of amyloid-β in the CSF measured by ELISA remained unaltered after mVEGF-C treatment. <b>k</b>, Representative images of dorsal hippocampi of J20 mice treated with eGFP or mVEGF-C stained with DAPI (cyan) and for IBA1 (green) and amyloid-β (red). Scale bar, 500 μm. <b>l-n</b>, No changes were observed in amyloid plaque size (<b>l</b>), number (<b>m</b>) or coverage (<b>n</b>) between the groups. Data in <b>i</b>, <b>j</b>, <b>l-n</b> are mean ± s.e.m., <i>n</i> = 6 per group, two-tailed Mann–Whitney U-test; data in <b>g-n</b>obtained from a single experiment. <b>o</b>, J20 mice (2–3 months old), 5xFAD mice (3–4 months old) and respective age-matched wild-type littermate controls were injected with fluorescent OVA-A647 (i.c.m.) in order to measure drainage into the dCLNs. <b>p</b>, Representative images of DAPI (blue) and LYVE-1 (green) staining in dCLNs of wild-type and J20 mice 2 h after injection of OVA-A647 (red). Scale bar, 200 μm. <b>q</b>, Quantification of OVA-A647 area fraction (%) in the dCLNs shows equal levels of tracer in mice from both genotypes. Data are mean ± s.e.m., n = 5 per group, two-tailed Mann–Whitney U-test, representative of two independent experiments. <b>r</b>, Representative images of DAPI (blue) and LYVE-1 (green) staining in dCLNs of wild-type and 5xFAD mice 2 h after injection of OVA-A594 (red). Scale bars, 200 μ μm. s, Quantification of OVA-A594 area fraction (%) in the dCLNs shows equal levels of tracer in mice from both genotypes. Data are mean ± s.e.m., <i>n</i> = 11 per group, two-tailed Mann–Whitney U-test, data were pooled from two independent experiments. t, Representative images of DAPI (blue) and LYVE-1 (green) staining in meningeal whole-mounts of wild-type and 5xFAD mice at 3–4 months. Scale bar, 1 mm. <b>u</b>, Measurement of LYVE-1+ vessel diameter, area fraction and number of sprouts (per mm of vessel) showed no differences between genotypes. Data are mean ± s.e.m., <i>n</i> = 7 per group, two-tailed Mann–Whitney U-test; data were pooled from two independent experiments. <a href="">Source data</a> </p>

    	<p>a, Representative images of blood flow (mm s−1) and arterial and venous blood oxygenation (percentage of sO2) readings obtained by photoacoustic imaging of brain/meningeal vasculature of 5xFAD mice one week after vehicle with photoconversion, visudyne or visudyne with photoconversion. <b>c</b>, <b>c</b>, The different treatments did not affect blood flow (<b>b</b>) or blood oxygenation (<b>c</b>) in the brain/meninges of 5xFAD mice. Data are mean ± s.e.m., <i>n</i> = 5 per group, one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni’s post hoc test (<b>b</b>), two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni’s post hoc test (<b>c</b>), data were from a single experiment. <b>d</b>, Representative flow cytometry dot and contour plots showing the gating strategies used to determine the frequency of specific immune cell populations, using a myeloid or lymphoid panel of markers, in the meninges of 5xFAD after prolonged (1.5 months) meningeal lymphatic ablation. <b>e</b>, Analysis of specific immune cell populations in the meninges of 5xFAD mice from the different groups showed a significant increase in macrophages in the visudyne with photoconversion group compared to the control groups. A significant increase in neutrophils was observed in visudyne group, but not in vehicle with photoconversion group compared to visudyne with photoconversion group. Data are mean ± s.e.m., <i>n</i> = 5 per group; two-way ANOVA with Holm–Sidak’s post hoc test, *versus vehicle with photoconversion, #versus visudyne; data obtained from a single experiment. <b>f</b>, J20 mice aged 4–5 months were subjected to meningeal lymphatic ablation by injection (i.c.m.) of visudyne or vehicle as a control, followed by a photoconversion step. This procedure was repeated every three weeks, for a total of three months, to achieve prolonged meningeal lymphatic ablation. <b>g</b>, Staining with DAPI (blue) and for LYVE-1 (green) and amyloid-β (red) in meningeal whole-mounts of J20 mice showing marked amyloid deposition in mice from the visudyne group. Scale bar, 500 μm. <b>h</b>, Representative brain sections of J20 mice at 7–8 months of age stained with DAPI (cyan) and for amyloid-β (red) showing degree of amyloid deposition after meningeal lymphatic ablation. Scale bar, 500 μm. <b>i-k</b>, Quantification of amyloid plaque size (<b>i</b>), number (<b>j</b>) and coverage (<b>k</b>) in the dorsal hippocampus of J20 mice showed a statistically significant increase in coverage in the visudyne group compared to vehicle. Data in <b>i-k</b> are mean ± s.e.m., <i>n</i> = 5 vehicle-treated mice, <i>n</i> = 6 visudyne-treated mice; two-tailed Mann–Whitney U-test; experiments in <b>f-k</b> were performed once. l, <b>m</b>, Sections of human brain cortex, containing meningeal layers (leptomeninges) attached, from the brain of a control (<b>l</b>) (scale bars, 500 μm and 200 μm (inset)) and the brain of a patient with Alzheimer’s disease (<b>m</b>) (scale bars, 100 μm (left) and 500 μm (right)) were stained with DAPI (blue), for the astrocyte marker GFAP (green) and for amyloid-β (red). Data in <b>l</b> and m are from <i>n</i> = 8 controls and <i>n</i> = 9 patients with Alzheimer’s disease and are representative of two independent experiments. <a href="">Source data</a></p>
